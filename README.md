# Hi, I'm Tanmay! 👋

## About Me

🎮 I'm on the exciting journey of becoming a game developer! While I'm just starting out and don't have game development experience yet, I'm eager to explore this captivating world of code and creativity.

🎸 Apart from coding, I'm also passionate about music and art. I love playing the guitar and piano, and I enjoy expressing my creativity through drawing.

## Learning Game Development

⏱️ My focus right now is on learning and experimenting with game development. I'm particularly intrigued by crafting innovative gameplay mechanics, much like the ones found in games like Katana Zero, where players experience those "aha" moments.

🎮 One day, I hope to embark on a unique journey where I'll create a game entirely on my own. From crafting the sprites to composing the soundtrack and writing the code, it's a dream I'm working towards.

## Stay Tuned!

🎮 I'm not looking for collaborations at the moment, as I'm still in the early stages of my coding journey. Instead, I'm inviting you to join me on this adventure. Stay tuned for my future projects and progress as I delve deeper into the world of game development.
